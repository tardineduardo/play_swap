- Run "*make*".

- Type "**tabs -4**" in your terminal to ensure the tab alignment works.

- Run ./play 3 4 5 2, etc. You can enter as many integers as you want, but larger values (3+ digits) will misalign the stack.

- Movements are stored in **moves.txt**.

This "sandbox mode" for the **push_swap** exercise is for students who are at the very beginning of the project and want to develop their own algorithms (if your preferred learning style is to start by reading available solutions, then this may not appeal to you). It provides a very basic environment for freely moving numbers around while keeping track of your movements (no need for endless sheets of paper or overloading your brain with abstraction).

Keep in mind that:
1) Some algorithms may perform well with smaller stacks but can dramatically lose efficiency with larger ones. Once your project compiles, you will be able to test your algorithm with and see how it works with of the many excellent push_swap visualizers available.
2) My goal was to replicate the example showed in the subject. It doesn't mean it's the best way to visualize how an specific algorithm works.
